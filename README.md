## Here you'll find some "basic" python scripts I wrote in order to help me in several other projects.
*(Remark: Some of those scripts may be outdated and present some errors. Furthermore, even the programming logic and structure would change if I hat to implement them again. )*

### Let's have a quick review of all those scripts and what they do.
- **csv_image_converter.py**:
    - Mainly, this program converts data from a csv file to images. It was used for the generation/modification of a dataset used in the training of a CNN (Convolutional neural network) model
    - Images are positions of the hand and the goal was to be able to train a model detecting the gesture of the hand.
